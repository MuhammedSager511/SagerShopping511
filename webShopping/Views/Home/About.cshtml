        <p class="text-center">
            Our project of developing an online store using MVC design pattern and ASP.NET technology is an important step towards providing an integrated and user-friendly shopping experience to customers. This project allows effective management of users, products, categories, and shopping carts, while providing an integrated ordering system that helps meet customer needs quickly and accurately.
        </p>
        <p class="text-center">
            The various controllers in the project have been carefully designed to ensure optimal performance and high security. Access to sensitive functions such as managing users and requests has been restricted to only authorized administrators.
        </p>
        <p class="text-center">
            By leveraging the interactive UI integrated with Bootstrap, the user experience is optimized to be smooth and intuitive, while providing instant notifications to improve interaction with the system.
        </p>
        <p class="text-center">
            Although we have made great progress on this project, there is always room for improvement. Future recommendations include enhancing security measures, improving performance through techniques such as lazy loading, and adding new features to improve the user experience such as advanced search and filtering options.
